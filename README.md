# **blackpoly**

This was an attempt to create an online multiplayer monopoly game on telegram. 
The project was meant to get my feets wet with go. But it ended shortly after I realized the 
user-interface wasn't that suitable. But I learnt alot from this mini project about working with 
pointers, array(slices) and so on. If you want to see how far I went, install the reqiured packages,
input your api_token in telegram/bot.go
then run
`go run main/main.go`

and if for some reason you like what you see and like to continue feel free to fork it. 

Happy coding.
